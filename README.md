# Bank-customer-churn-prediction

Problem Statement:

     A major European commercial bank is losing customers to competitors. Because customer churn is a huge issue in the banking industry, the bank wants to figure out what is causing the dissatisfaction. To be competitive, the bank wants to focus on customer retention rather than new customer acquisition because the latter is more expensive.

Solution:

   A statistical prediction model would be constructed using the customer data and attributes to estimate the likelihood of the customer leaving the bank. Following pattern detection, recommendations would be made to the bank on how to act on and target these clients in order to reduce churn.
