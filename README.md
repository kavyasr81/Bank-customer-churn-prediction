# Bank-customer-churn-prediction

### Problem Statement:

     A major European commercial bank is losing customers to competitors. Because customer churn is a huge issue in the banking industry, the bank wants to figure out what is causing the dissatisfaction. To be competitive, the bank wants to focus on customer retention rather than new customer acquisition because the latter is more expensive.
     

### Solution:

   A statistical prediction model would be constructed using the customer data and attributes to estimate the likelihood of the customer leaving the bank. Following pattern detection, recommendations would be made to the bank on how to act on and target these clients in order to reduce churn.
   
##### Data Description
- Data-set is a collection of customer demographic and interaction with the bank.
- Data-set sourced from kaggle
- It has a total of 14 columns 
- Total of 10,000 independent customer records
- Target variable  is “Exited”
- Target variable has only two values 0 and 1 
- 0 means the customer stays with the bank
- 1 means the customer leaves the bank.
